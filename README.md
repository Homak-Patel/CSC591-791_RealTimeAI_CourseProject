# LPRNet Optimization Project  

This repository contains the work related to optimizing the LPRNet model using techniques such as pruning, quantization, and MLC autotuning. The steps to run this project are straightforward, as everything is handled within the provided Google Colab notebook.

## Steps to Run the Project  

1. Open the **Google Colab Notebook** provided in this repository.  
2. Clone the original LPRNet model GitHub repository directly in the notebook. This step is already scripted in the notebook, so no manual cloning is required.  
3. Run all the cells in the notebook sequentially.  
4. All required results, including accuracy, inference time, and other metrics, will be generated automatically.

## Key Notes  

- **No Additional Setup:** There is no need to install or configure anything locally. All dependencies and setups are handled within the Colab notebook.  
- **Metrics Variability:** Since the code runs in the Google Colab environment, metrics (such as accuracy and inference time) might slightly vary each time you run the notebook due to runtime differences.  

## Repository Structure  

- **Google_Colab_Notebook.ipynb**: The main notebook containing all the scripts for cloning the model, running optimizations, and analyzing results.  
- **README.md**: This file provides instructions for running the project.  
- **CSC591/791_RealTimeAI_CourseProject_Report.pdf**: A detailed report on the project, including the results, methodology, and lessons learned.

## Report Details  

The report, **CSC591/791_RealTimeAI_CourseProject_Report.pdf**, summarizes the techniques used for optimizing LPRNet, the observations made during experimentation, and the lessons learned. It provides an in-depth look into the project's outcomes and serves as a comprehensive reference for the work performed.

## Author and Course Details  

This project was completed as part of the course **CSC591/791 Real-Time AI and High Performance Machine Learning Systems** at **North Carolina State University**.
